## How to install from Source

Note, I usually put copies of the current Development versions, including the jszip library, in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B_X2WcsaI_eg9yA-5bHJb8VeTZGKExl8?usp=sharing
So, get the relevant zip, then 
* For Chrome, just do step 2 then steps 6 to 9
* For Firefox, just do step 3, then steps 8 to 14

### Chrome
1. Download the extension. 
    1. For most recent release, go to https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub and click on the "Download Zip" button.
    2. For current development branch, go to https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub/tree/ExperimentalTabMode and click on the "Download Zip" button.
2. Unpack zip file and move the "plugin" directory to the location you want to keep it.
3. In the "plugin" directory from the previous step there is a "jszip" directory.  Create a "dist" directory inside this "jszip" directory.
4. Download jszip library v3.0.0 from https://github.com/Stuk/jszip
5. Extract jszip.min.js from the jszip library and copy to the "dist" directory you created in step 3.
6. Open Chrome and type "chrome://extensions" into the browser.
7. Make sure "Developer Mode" at the top of the page is checked.
8. Press the "Load unpacked extension.." button and browse to the "plugin" directory from step 2.
9. On Chrome you may see a warning message "Unrecognized manifest key 'applications'."  This can be safely ignored.  (The source version supports both Firefox and Chrome. The 'applications' key is needed by Firefox, but Chrome does not recognise it.)

### Firefox
1. ~~Make sure you can install unsigned addons (only possible in Nightly and Developer Edition).~~
2. Download the extension.
    1. For most recent release, go to https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub and click on the "Download Zip" button.
    2. For current development branch, go to https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub/tree/ExperimentalTabMode and click on the "Download Zip" button.
3. Unpack zip file and move the "plugin" directory to the location you want to keep it.
4. Open the file manifest.json in the plugin directory with a text editor and delete the line that goes: <br>"incognito": "split",<br>
5. In the "plugin" directory from the previous step there is a "jszip" directory.  Create a "dist" directory inside this "jszip" directory.
6. Download jszip library v3.0.0 from https://github.com/Stuk/jszip
7. Extract jszip.min.js from the jszip library and copy to the "dist" directory you created in step 4.
8. Open Firefox and type "about:addons" into the URL bar.
9. Click "Load Temporary Add-on".
10. Select "Extensions"
11. Click the icon that looks like a gear that is on the right of "Manage Your Extensions"
12. Click "Debug Add-ons"
13. Click "Load Temporary Add-on"
14. Select "manifest.json" from the directory in step 4

## Other notes
### To run unit tests under Chrome
* Close all running copies of Chrome 
* Start Chrome with command line argument --allow-file-access-from-files
* Load unitTest/Tests.html
* If you get **_Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from 'Window': Access is denied for this document_** errors
    * Type **_chrome://settings/content_** into Chrome's search bar 
    * Uncheck **_Block third-party cookies and site data_**
    * Click **_Finished_**
    * Re-run unit tests
* When finished with unit tests. 
    * Restore original value of **_Block third-party cookies and site data_** (if you changed it).
    * close all running copies of Chrome

### To run unit tests under Firefox
* Start Firefox 
* Go to about:config
* Find security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy parameter
* Set it to false
* Load unitTest/Tests.html
* (Remember to reset security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy to true when done.

### To run eslint (and build the plugin)
* Install Node.js (if not already installed)  At time of writing, I'm using version 6.9.1.
* Use node's package manager to download and install eslint and the "xmldom" https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmldom package. (Needed by pack.js)
* Use Node.js to run eslint/pack.js
* This will produce 3 files in the eslint directory.
    * WebToEpub0.0.0.x.xpi   (Firefox version of plug-in.)
    * WebToEpub0.0.0.x.zip   (Chrome version of plug-in.)
    * packed.js  (All JavaScript files packaged into single file, for eslint to examine.)
* Command line for eslint is "eslint packed.js > error.txt"
