## How to install from Source (for developers)
1. Clone this repo
2. Build extension. See "To run Eslint (and build the plugin)" in "Other notes" below.
3. Install extension in browser of choice, using instructions above.

## License information
Licenced under GPLv3.

WebToEpub uses the following libraries:
* JSZip library v3.0.0: https://github.com/Stuk/jszip, which is dual licensed with the MIT license or GPLv3.
* quint: http://qunitjs.com/, licensed under MIT license.

## Other notes
### To run Eslint (and build the plugin)
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if not already installed)
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm run lint` to build plugin and lint
* This will produce 3 files in the eslint directory.
    * WebToEpub0.0.0.x.xpi   (Firefox version of plug-in.)
    * WebToEpub0.0.0.x.zip   (Chrome version of plug-in.)
    * packed.js
* Lint tests are OK if output ends with `Wrote Zip to disk; Done in XXXs.`

### To run unit tests
* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (if not already installed)
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* Run `npm test`
* Tests will be launched in your default browser. To open them in different browser, open the page URL in it.

> ### To run unit tests without Node.js
> * If you are not trying to run unit tests in `/unitTest/` folder, you do not need this
> * If you can use nodejs, see previous paragraph instead
> * If you can not install nodejs or http-server is not working when you run `npm test`, and you have no alternative ways to serve files (like [chrome Web Server app](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) for example), you have to allow browser to run local html files to run tests.
> #### To run unit tests (without local server) under Chrome
> * Close all running copies of Chrome 
> * Start Chrome with command line argument `--allow-file-access-from-files`.  That is:
>     * Open a command propmt
>     * Browse to the directory holding Chrome
>     * Type in command `chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files` . Press "Enter".
>     * If you don't do this, some tests will fail with error messages containing the text **_Failed to execute 'send' on 'XMLHttpRequest': Failed to load_**.
> * Load `unitTest/Tests.html`
> * If you get **_Failed to read the 'localStorage' property from 'Window': Access is denied for this document_** errors
>     * Type **_chrome://settings/content_** into Chrome's search bar 
>     * Uncheck **_Block third-party cookies and site data_**
>     * Click **_Finished_**
>     * Re-run unit tests
> * When finished with unit tests. 
>     * Restore original value of **_Block third-party cookies and site data_** (if you changed it).
>     * close all running copies of Chrome
> 
> #### To run unit tests (without local server) under Firefox
> * Start Firefox 
> * Go to `about:config`
> * Find `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` parameter
> * Set it to false
> * Load `unitTest/Tests.html`
> * (Remember to reset `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` to true when done.
